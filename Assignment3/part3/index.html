        <h2>Brave new world</h2>
      
        <p>It's a brave new world out there. Our children are being put in increasing more competitive situations, both during recreation, and 
            as they start to move into the adult world of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Examination">examinations</a>, 
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jobs">jobs</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Career">careers</a>, and other life choices.
